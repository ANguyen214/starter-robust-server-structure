# Starter Code: Robust server structure

This server is intended to be run for some checkpoints in the Thinkful curriculum. If you have trouble getting the server to run, reach out to your mentor.

## Installation Instructions

1. Clone this repository.
1. `cd` into the newly created directory.
1. Run `npm install`.
1. Run `npm start`.

Running `npm start` will spin up a server on port 5000.

Running `npm run dev` will spin up a server on port 5000 that will automatically restart when changes are made to source files.

## Description

This project is the minimum setup required to have an Express API. However, only the not found and error handler is implemented at this point.

Follow the instructions in the checkpoins for implementing the API.

If you have trouble, reach out to your mentor.
